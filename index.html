          <li>Childhood: 1918–1934</li>
          <p> Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given
            the forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker", in later years he became known by his
            clan name, Madiba. His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people in the Transkeian
            Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province. One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's
            grandfather and the source of his surname. Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called
            "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit
            the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.</p>
          <li>Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941–1943</li>
          <p>eturning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice;
            dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941.[39] Mandela found work as a night watchman
            at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the induna (headman)
            discovered that he was a runaway. He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela to realtor
            and ANC activist Walter Sisulu. The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of Witkin,
            Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause</p>
          <li>Arrest and Rivonia trial: 1962–1964</li>
          <p>n 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick.Many MK members suspected
            that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these
            ideas little credence. In later years, a former American diplomat revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency,
            who feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of his location. Jailed
            in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country
            without permission. Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase
            "the ANC's moral opposition to racism" while supporters demonstrated outside the court.</p>
